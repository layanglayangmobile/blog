title: Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll to Serve Our Blog
---

Hi, did you know if we use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to serve our blog here? Yes, we use those tech stack to keep things simple, like we don't have to deal with database and don't have to deal with manual Wordpress upgrade which is cumbersome sometimes. Hey, Wordpress are great too, and we think by using GitHub Pages and Jekyll the development and deployment become more simpler. Awesome, isn't it?

There is always a trade-off when using any technologies in your daily life, so Jekyll's too. Blogging using this platform it's a bit different than we are used to when using Wordpress. One thing you have to know is you blogging using Markdown syntax. We just try this yet, so let's see how far we can go.

Btw, we'd love to mention this blog is using [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme. Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler. Hyde is written by Mark Otto, and it's such a great minimalist theme.
